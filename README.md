homework 1 part 1

In my everyday work life, I tend to be in charge of people, while not a manager i  take and divide the list of food we are supposed to prepare and divide it amongst the crew to work on. If I have to prepare deserts for example, I might further decompose them into deserts from the fridge, and those from the freezer. Staying on the topic of work, another way I might use computational thinking principles is that when I prep foods it helps me to categorize them by ingredients, for instance instead of making ten fruit cups one by one, i might make the first layer for each cup, and then the second layer, reducing the amount of times i have to change gloves from ten to one and recucing cross contamination. I think fundementaly computational thinking principles are no different in the everyday life and an academic enviroment beacause fundementaly it is a way of thinking not rules for work. It assists in breaking down a problem and makes it more managle to be solved, and problems exist in everyday life, same as work. This undermines the idea that "streetsmarts" and "booksmarts" are fundementaly different because ultimately they are both someones ability to process information, which computational thinking principles help with.
